[whatdaybob/sonarr_youtubedl](https://github.com/whatdaybob/Custom_Docker_Images/tree/master/sonarr_youtubedl) is a [Sonarr](https://sonarr.tv/) companion script to allow the automatic downloading of web series normally not available for Sonarr to search for. Using [Youtube-DL](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) it allows you to download your webseries from the list of [supported sites](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html).

## Features

* Downloading **Web Series** using online sources normally unavailable to Sonarr
* Ability to specify the downloaded video format globally or per series
* Downloads new episodes automatically once available
* Imports directly to Sonarr and it can then update your plex as and example
* Allows setting time offsets to handle prerelease series
* Can pass cookies.txt to handle site logins

## How do I use it

Firstly you need a series that is available online in the supported sites that YouTube-DL can grab from.
Secondly you need to add this to Sonarr and monitor the episodes that you want.
Thirdly edit your config.yml accordingly so that this knows where your Sonarr is, which series you are after and where to grab it from.
Lastly be aware that this requires the TVDB to match exactly what the episodes titles are in the scan, generally this is ok but as it's an openly editable site sometime there can be differences. Use [regexes](#episode-title-regex-support) to bridge the gap between Sonarr and YouTube.

## Great how do I get started

Obviously its a docker image so you need docker, if you don't know what that is you need to look into that first.

### docker

```bash
docker create \
  --name=sonarr_youtubedl \
  -v /path/to/data:/config \
  -v /path/to/sonarrmedia:/sonarr_root \
  -v /path/to/logs:/logs \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  whatdaybob/sonarr_youtubedl
```

### docker-compose

```yaml
---
version: '3.4'
services:
  sonarr_youtubedl:
    image: whatdaybob/sonarr_youtubedl
    container_name: sonarr_youtubedl
    volumes:
      - /path/to/data:/config
      - /path/to/sonarrmedia:/sonarr_root
      - /path/to/logs:/logs
```

### Docker volumes

| Parameter | Function |
| :----: | --- |
| `-v /config` | sonarr_youtubedl configs |
| `-v /sonarr_root` | Root library location from Sonarr container |
| `-v /logs` | log location |

**Clarification on sonarr_root**

A couple of people are not sure what is meant by the sonarr root. As this downloads directly to where you media is stored I mean the root folder where sonarr will place the files. So in sonarr you have your files moving to `/mnt/sda1/media/tv/Smarter Every Day/` as an example, in sonarr you will see that it saves this series to `/tv/Smarter Every Day/` meaning the sonarr root is `/mnt/sda1/media/` as this is the root folder sonarr is working from.

## Configuration file

On first run the docker will create a template file in the config folder. Example [config.yml.template](./app/config.yml.template)

Copy the `config.yml.template` to a new file called `config.yml` and edit accordingly.

#### Episode title regex support

When the episode titles in Sonarr and YouTube differ, you can specify regexes that will rewrite the Sonarr episode title to match those found on YouTube. The configuration per series is as follows:

```yaml
series:
  - title: Example
    url: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=example
    regex:
      sonarr:
        - match: 'France'
          replace: '(ep#1)'
        - match: 'America'
          replace: '(ep#2)'
        - match: 'Mexico/India'
          replace: '(ep#3)'
```

Each regex will be executed in sequence. The Sonarr episode title is the input for the first regex, and the output of each regex is used as the input for the next in the list.
